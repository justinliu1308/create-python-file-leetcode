# Generate Local Python File for LeetCode Problems

For online LeetCode users who wish to work on and store code offline, this reads a problem-specific URL and:
- Creates a local Python file with the appropriate file name
- Adds the problem information
- Launches the new file to be worked on (Windows function only)

Usage:
1. Replace variable 'link' with the full URL of the LeetCode problem (ex: 'https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/')
2. In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you intend to generate the new Python file
3. Run main.py
